# SvelteKit Tailwind Starter

Everything you need to build a SvelteKit project, preconfigured with TailwindCSS plugins.

## Skip the Setup

Save time and use this template to get up and running quickly. A skeleton SvelteKit project with Tailwind configured and extended for easy font and color customization.

The official Tailwind Forms, Line Clamp, and Typography plug-ins have already been installed. To remove a plug-in, run:

```bash
# replace with the right plugin name
npm uninstall @tailwindcss/plugin -D

```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
